After logging in, click your avatar in the top-right corner and choose **Profile** from the dropdown.

![Click Profile](./assets/click-profile.png)

---

## ⭐ Step 2 · Add Template

In the **My Templates** section of the Profile page, click **Add Template** in the top-right, and create your own template in the form that pops up.

![Add Template](./assets/add-template.png)

### ① Add Title

Give the template a name (Title, required).

### ② Choose Container Image

Choose a Container Image (required).

![Add Title & Container Image](./assets/add-template-form.png)

If you want your files to persist, set **Storage** to **Persistent (PVC)** — its data is kept even after the instance is destroyed. 

Click **Add Template** at the bottom to finish.

---

## ⭐ Step 3 · Launch template

Back in the **My Templates** list, click **Launch** on the row of the template you just created to start an instance.

---

## ⭐ Step 4 · Enter the environment (pick one of two ways)

### Option A · JupyterLab Terminal

Once the instance is ready and the dialog shows **Your workspace is ready (100%)**, click **Open Notebook**.

![Open Notebook](./assets/open-notebook.png)

Your browser opens **JupyterLab** in a new tab — the instance's default access point. You get a full development environment right in the browser:

- **Terminal**: a full Linux terminal (click `+` at the top → Terminal, or the Terminal tile in the Launcher) for installing, downloading, and starting services
- **Notebook (.ipynb)**: a live document mixing code and output
- **File browser**: upload/manage files on the left (click the upload button `↑` to bring in your own `.ipynb`)

![JupyterLab workspace](./assets/jupyterlab.png)

### Option B · SSH

**① Add your SSH public key in Profile**

- Generate a key pair locally (skip if you already have one). macOS / Linux / Windows PowerShell:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  This creates `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private key) and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public key) by default.

- Copy the public key content (`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`), paste it into the **SSH Public Key** box on the Profile page, and click **Save Key**.

![Add SSH public key in Profile](./assets/ssh-key.png)

> ⚠️ Only paste the `.pub` **public key** — never paste the private key.

**② Enable SSH Access in Add Template**

When creating a template (Step 2), turn on the **SSH Access (advanced)** toggle at the bottom of the form before clicking Add Template. Only instances launched from SSH-enabled templates can be reached via SSH.

![Enable SSH Access](./assets/ssh-access.png)

**Connect to the instance**

1. After the instance starts, the ready dialog (and the **Active Instance** section in Profile) shows **SSH access** — with a copy-ready **Command** and **Host : Port** (host, port, and username, as shown on the page).

![SSH connection info](./assets/ssh-connect.png)

2. Connect from a local terminal:

   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> -p <port>
   ```

   Replace `<user>`, `<host>`, and `<port>` with the actual values shown in the instance details; type `yes` when prompted to confirm the fingerprint on first connect.


> [!NOTE]
> Some images may not include an SSH server by default. If `sshd` is unavailable, install and start it manually in terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
mkdir -p /run/sshd
which sshd
/usr/sbin/sshd
```

## ⭐ Using Model APIs (OpenAI-compatible)

Besides opening a notebook, Radeon Cloud can serve models behind an **OpenAI-compatible HTTP API**, so any OpenAI-compatible client (curl, the `openai` SDK, Cherry Studio, LangChain, …) can call them. There are two options.

### Option 1 · Free Model APIs (shared, no instance needed)

Ready-to-use shared endpoints — no GPU instance to launch, no credits spent. Currently **Qwen** and **DeepSeek** are available.

1. Open the **Token Factory** page and log in with your account:
   https://developer.amd.com.cn/radeon/modelapis

![Token Factory](./assets/modelapi-tokenfactory.png)

2. Under **Public Free Model APIs**, pick a model (Qwen or DeepSeek). The detail dialog shows the **Base URL**, the **Model** name, your **API Key**, and a ready-to-run **Quickstart (curl)**. Copy your API key.

![Free Model API detail](./assets/modelapi-free-detail.png)

3. Call it from any terminal (replace `<API_KEY>` with your key):

   ```bash
   curl https://developer.amd.com.cn/radeon/api/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"Qwen3.6-35B-A3B","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
   ```

   The same key works for all shared models — just change the `model` field (e.g. `DeepSeek-V4-Flash`).

### Option 2 · Dedicated Model APIs (your own instance)

Deploy your own model as a dedicated OpenAI-compatible endpoint (uses your credits).

1. Go to https://radeon-global.anruicloud.com/ → **Profile** → **Add Template**.
2. Set **Deploy Type = vLLM Model API** (Radeon only supports vLLM), then fill in the required **Serve Command** yourself:

![Dedicated Model API template](./assets/modelapi-dedicated-template.png)

   - Write your own serve command following the format shown in the form (`vllm serve <model> --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).
   - **Keep `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`** — the platform routes the endpoint to port 8000.

3. Click **Add Template**, then **Launch** it from **My Templates**. When ready, the dialog shows a dedicated **Base URL** (`.../spaces/<id>/8000/v1`), **Model**, and **API Key** — call it exactly like Option 1, using this Base URL.

## ⭐ Expose a Notebook service to the internet (Tunnel)

Expose an HTTP/WebSocket service running inside your Notebook to a public URL using the built-in `rc-tunnel` tool.

### Prerequisites

- Works only for Notebooks created after this feature was enabled on the platform. Older Notebooks created before enablement must be closed and recreated.
- Only HTTP/WebSocket services listening on `127.0.0.1` inside the Notebook are supported.
- The local port must be in the range `1024-65535` and must not be a platform-reserved port.
- The domain is assigned automatically by the platform, in the format `rc-<random>.radeon.firstdg.ai`.
- Each Notebook Pod can expose only one port at a time.
- The public URL is reachable from the internet — your app itself must enforce login or other authentication. Do not expose an unauthenticated admin page.

### Install

Run this in the Notebook Terminal:

```bash
/var/run/secrets/frp-self-service/install
```

The script installs to `$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel` and adds it to PATH for future Terminals. In the current Terminal, use the full path directly.

If the identity directory or `FRP_BROKER_URL` does not exist, your Notebook is an old Pod created before the feature was enabled. Close and recreate the Notebook, then try again. Do not request or write platform keys yourself.

A new Terminal can run `rc-tunnel version` directly. If you are not using Bash, first run:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Start a test page

Create a test directory and start an HTTP server:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/tunnel-demo"
printf '%s\n' '<!doctype html><title>RC Tunnel</title><h1>RC Tunnel is working</h1>' \
  > "$HOME/tunnel-demo/index.html"
nohup python3 -m http.server 8081 --bind 127.0.0.1 \
  --directory "$HOME/tunnel-demo" \
  > "$HOME/tunnel-demo/http.log" 2>&1 &
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8081/
```

### Expose the port

The following command automatically requests an available domain and exposes local port `8081`:

```bash
"$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel" expose --port 8081
```

It returns the platform-assigned URL and the FRPC PID; the URL is usually reachable within a few seconds, for example:

```text
https://rc-0123456789abcdef.radeon.firstdg.ai
```

For ops-compatibility scenarios you can still use `--prefix` to specify a prefix; regular users don't need it.

### Check and troubleshoot

```bash
"$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel" status
"$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel" logs --lines 100
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8081/
```

Diagnose in this order:

1. Local `curl` fails: the app in the Notebook isn't listening on that port — this is unrelated to FRP.
2. `status` shows FRPC not running: check `rc-tunnel logs`.
3. Status is fine but public access fails: give ops the full domain, the Notebook creation time, and the failure time. Do not send any config files or keys.

### Stop

```bash
"$HOME/.local/bin/rc-tunnel" stop
```

After stopping, the public URL becomes invalid immediately, and the domain prefix enters a 24-hour freeze period. When FRPC or the Pod is terminated, FRPS usually detects the closed connection immediately; half-open or never-connected tunnels are revoked by the VM after 60 seconds without a heartbeat.

### Limitations

- TCP, UDP, SSH, database ports, and custom full domains are not supported.
- Do not manually edit `~/.local/state/rc-tunnel/frpc.toml`.
- Do not copy `~/.local/state/rc-tunnel` to another Pod or share it with anyone.
- After a Notebook is recreated, you must run the install and `expose` again.

## ⭐ Destroy the instance when done

A running instance keeps consuming credits. When you're done, go to the **Active Instance** section in Profile and click the red **Destroy Instance** button to destroy it.
